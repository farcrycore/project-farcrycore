						FarCry Core doesn''t limit you to "out-of-the-box" content types. You can build

						hand-craft your code in your favourite editor.

						Core''s programming model. Developers spend less time pondering and searching, and 
						more time building great things.

					<h2>What is the FarCry licensing model?</h2>
					<p>The FarCry Platform is release under a dual-license model: GNU GPL License v3 (GPL) and Commercial. Many of the plugins used in conjunction with FarCry are released under Limited GPL (LGPL), dual-license LGPL/Commercial and a few just Commercial.</p>
					<p>The GNU General Public License (GPL) and Limited GPL are the most widely used free and open source software (FOSS) licenses in the world. The GPL was created and sponsored by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).</p>
					<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h2>Why would I want to consider a Commercial license?</h2>
					<p>First of all you may never need a Commercial license.  This is certainly true if you are happy to abide by the rules of the GPL open source license. In this instance you would be free to use and develop with FarCry to your heart''s content.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, if you are concerned about the implications of GPL and the prospect of having to publish your source then you need to purchase a Commercial license.</p>
					<p>A commercial license is just the same as most other closed source software; the license gives you the right to use the software under certain terms.  These terms would typically involve a right to use the software, on X number of CPUs (or some other criteria) to build your application.  We''re talking about a standard End User License Agreement (EULA). Licenses can be purchased from <a href="http://www.daemon.com.au/" target="_blank">Daemon Internet Consultants</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h2>Why are earlier versions of FarCry released under CPL?</h2>
					<p>When we originally open sourced FarCry way back in April 2003 we chose the Common Public License 1.0 (CPL).  The CPL has served us well over the last 5 years, however, it contains some restrictions that make the license incompatible with other open source licenses such as GPL, and does not enforce a principle of "Quid Pro Quo".</p>
					<p>We''d also like to offer companies the opportunity of a commercial license, to free those who need it from the obligations of open source licenses.  And also give companies an opportunity to give something back to the community, without the need to contribute code.</p>
					<p>The older FarCry 4.0 code base and maintenance branch will continue to be maintained under the CPL license for the foreseeable future.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-shield"></em><span>Role Based Security</span></h3>
				<p>An in-built authentication and authorization (users, groups, and permissions) service, the ability to secure individual views, and options to secure branches of content to specific groups of users. You can even build your own user directory components that open up the security model to just about any external service. The community already supports LDAP and other external directories.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-credit"></em><span>Database Connectivity: Object Relational Mapper</span></h3>
				<p>FarCry can be used to manage access to the database and the evolution of the underlying schema itself with little or no programming. There are several supported databases, including My SQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. No SQL is needed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-setting"></em><span>Administrative Webtop</span></h3>
				<p>The framework provides generic views for adding/deleting/modifying content items in the database - you can get away with not doing a lot if you''re inclined. The webtop is secured and completely configurable, providing the perfect interface for administrative menus and maintenance screens for all aspects of your application.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-link"></em><span>Friendly URL Configuration</span></h3>
				<p>Leveraging popular web servers like Apache and IIS, FarCry generates simple, clean, user friendly URLs automatically. This automation can be changed to reflect your requirements or overridden completely as needed by users of your application.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-rss"></em><span>Web Feeds</span></h3>
				<p>The framework can be configured to generate RSS, ATOM and iTunes feeds for syndication of just about any content type in the system. Feeds can be categorised and filtered to provide more select feeds for users.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-web-browser"></em><span>Content Management</span></h3>
				<p>The framework ships with a variety of standard content types or classes that can be used for "flat pages" or simple HTML content stored in the database and passed into a template for display.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-history"></em><span>Caching &amp; Performance</span></h3>
				<p>The framework automatically caches calls to the database to improve performance. Better still, the result of any view can be cached in memory allowing you to generate complex, composite pages and then retrieve them instantly from memory. FarCry even understands the way the cache has been constructed so that embedded views that change will flush and re-generate their parent pages automatically.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-share"></em><span>Content Hierarchies</span></h3>
				<p>The Nested Tree Model service allows for the construction and management of hierarchical content like a web sites IA, or an applications menu hierarchy. Out-of-the-box FarCry uses this to manage the site structure and category taxonomies.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-notes"></em><span>Formtools Engine</span></h3>
				<p>Formtools are components that represent the behaviour of individual properties when being displayed or rendered in a form. A property might be as simple as a text input field or a complex library picker. The framework ships with a huge dictionary of choices, and you can build and distribute your own components. Difficult to put in a little sound-bite but form tools lets you build very rich user interfaces very quickly.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3><em class="large-icon-plug"></em><span>Plugin Architecture</span></h3>
				<p>Every aspect of a project can be repackaged and used in another project as a plugin. This might be the entire project or just a small part of it. Most applications are combinations of several plugins. Community plugins include solutions for Google Maps, blogging, content management, free text search engines and many, many more.</p>
